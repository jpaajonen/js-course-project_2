# js-course-project_2
A basic movie theater search with AJAX.

The search page has two options, listings by theater or by search. I limited the listings to just Finnkino's theaters in Helsinki.
I had quite a lot of trouble getting started due to my schedule, so I basically did this in a week from start to finish.
I did not get the JSON to parse, so I just used XML. There apparently is an extra line in the Finnkino XML pages that makes
JSON stumble, and I didn't have the time to study the issue.

The two main features I wish I had had time to implement were showing only movies that are yet to be screened on the day and removing all the results when the search bar is emptied. Other than that (and the styling, of course), I'm quite pleased with the result for such a fast attempt.

As for the assignment specs:

A theater can be selected from a list.
The page shows pictures and info of ongoing movies in the theater.
Other info is also presented.
The layout isn't particularly nice, but its something.
There's an input field in the search bar.
The project is published in GitHub and Netlify.
The code is extensively commented (I left out repetition).
External libraries were not used.
CSS styles were used.
Event handlers were implemented dynamically.

The code could have been a lot more polished, but I'm still not familiar enough with object oriented programming for that in this timeframe.
